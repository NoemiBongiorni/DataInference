# Linear Regression for Bodyfat Percentage Prediction

This repository contains the project developed for the **MMIS** course (Milan, may 2024), focused on predicting bodyfat percentage using linear regression techniques.
This project analyzes body fat percentage in men and women using inference, linear regression, and ANOVA. Relationships with physiological factors are studied, and models are validated via cross-validation. Key insights and results are presented, offering robust tools for prediction and understanding of body fat variability.

## Participants
The project was carried out by:
- Eleonora Banterle
- Noemi Bongiorni
- Matteo Chiesa
- Luca Tagliabue

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict bodyfat percentage. The work involves:
- **Data Visualization**: Initial exploration of the dataset.
- **Preliminary Adjustments**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Assessing assumptions and model validity.
- **Model Selection**: Iterative improvement and variable selection to identify the final model.
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluating the modelâ€™s generalization capability.
- **Covariate Interactions**: Analyzing interactions among independent variables.
- **ANOVA**: Statistical analysis to compare models and validate results.

## Key Steps
1. **Preliminary Modifications**: Removing insignificant covariates (e.g., forearm, hip, thigh, neck).
2. **Final Model**: Selection based on performance metrics and hypothesis validation.
3. **Confidence and Prediction Intervals**: Providing reliable ranges for predictions.

## How to Use
